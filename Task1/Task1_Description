You are given a field of 16 cells (4 by 4). Each cell is a place to grow vegetables. First all cells are empty (white).
Once you click on a cell, it becomes black (planted, growing). Then it grows by itself. Once you click it once again, you harvest the vegetables, and the cell becomes empty.

Color description:
White - empty
Black - growing, just planted
Green - planting shoots
Yellow - immature
Red - mature
Brown - overgrow

Based on the example (we did during the class) you have to add two features to the model:

1. Add economics
-2 to plant seeds
+3 for harvesting immature vegetables (yellow)
+5 for harvesting mature vegetables (red)
-1 to harvest overripe vegetables (brown)

2. Add speed control
3-4 buttons to select different speed
