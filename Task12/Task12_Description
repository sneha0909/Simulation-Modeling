Statistics processing of simulation of discrete random variable with infinite number of values.
The application should implement the algorithm for series of experiments of simulation of discrete RV with infinite number of values (geometric,
negative binomial, Poisson), evaluation of empiric probabilities, empiric mean and variance, their errors, and performing chi-square test for various
values of N (N = 10, 100, 1 000, 10 000). Also, please, make a conclusion.
