Simulate two stationary Poisson point processes with different intensities 位1 and 位2. Capture events of both processes at
once. Such process is also called as an aggregate point process. Perform statistical data processing for the aggregate process.
Check does this process match the stationary Poisson point process with intensity (位1 + 位2).
