Statistics processing of discrete random variable simulation.
The application should implement algorithm for series of N simulations discrete RV with given distribution, evaluation of empiric probabilities,
empiric mean and variance, their errors, and performing chi-square test for various values of N (N = 10, 100, 1 000, 10 000). Please, make a
conclusion.
